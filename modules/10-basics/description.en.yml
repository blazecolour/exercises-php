  Learning to program is a pretty hard and long process. And it's not limited to the syntax of a language. I would actually say that learning syntax is the easiest and the shortest part of the whole thing, but you can't skip it. This Basics module is all about the simple, foundational things in PHP. It's the basis for writing programs.
